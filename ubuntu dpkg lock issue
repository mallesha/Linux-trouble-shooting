How to Fix ‘E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock’ Error in Ubuntu Linux
==========================================================================

check teh process running and kill them with -9

ps aux | grep -i apt
sudo kill -9 <process_id>

Use the lsof command to get the process ID of the process holding the lock files. 
Check the error and see what lock files it is complaining about and get the id of the processes holding these lock files.

sudo lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock
sudo lsof /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
sudo lsof /var/cache/apt/archives/lock


You can now safely remove the lock files using the commands below:

sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock

After that, reconfigure the packages:

sudo dpkg --configure -a

Now if you run the sudo apt update command, everything should be fine.
